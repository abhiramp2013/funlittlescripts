# funlittlescripts
Useful scripts and aliases written in bash ( probably portable to other shells ). Feel free to use them, and let me know if there are any issues or any comments.


IMPORTANT NOTE :
None of the aliases/scripts are perfect, they may not account for many conditions, diligence is the user's responsiblity :)
